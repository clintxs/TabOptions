		<h1>Tab Options Help</h1>
		<h2>Hotkeys</h2>
		
		<p>
			Each command in Tab Options can have up to three hotkeys that trigger it. To set a hotkey, click inside one of the three input boxes for the command of interest and press the desired key combination. The hotkey is saved immediately and can be used right away.</p>
		<p>
			A hotkey can be any character key, with or without modifiers such as Command, Option, and Shift. By &quot;character key&quot; we mean any key that produces a visible character if you press it while typing text. (This excludes special keys such as PageDown, Home, NumLock, the arrow keys, etc.)</p>
		<p>
			If you enter a key combination involving the Shift and/or Option keys, what appears in the input box is the character that would appear if you typed that key combination normally. So, for example, if you press Option-Y, you will see the character <span class='char'>&yen;</span> in the input box, not the words "Option-Y"; but your hotkey will in fact be Option-Y.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Note</strong>: If you enter a hotkey that is normally assigned to a built-in Safari command, such as âŒ˜P for printing the current page, the Tab Options action will override and prevent the default action.</p>
